# Census-Income-Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for predicting income levels based on the U.S. Census Bureau data. The goal is to determine whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 annually.

## Project Overview

The Census-Income dataset, also known as the "Adult" dataset, includes various demographic and employment-related features. We apply Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest classifiers to predict the income bracket of individuals, addressing challenges such as class imbalance and feature selection.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Census-Income-Prediction.git](https://github.com/DamithaWee/Census-Income-prediction.git)
cd Census-Income-Prediction
